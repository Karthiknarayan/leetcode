# ðŸ”¸ Problem Statement:
# You're given a sorted array.
# Modify it in-place so that each unique element appears at most 3 times.

# Return the new length of the array after removal.
# All remaining elements should be at the beginning of the array.

# âœ… Examples:
# ðŸ“˜ Example 1:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# Input:  nums = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3]
# Output: [1,1,1,2,2,3]
# Length: 6
# ðŸŸ¢ Explanation:

# 1 appears 4 times â†’ keep only 3

# 2 appears 2 times â†’ keep both

# 3 appears once â†’ keep it

# ðŸ“˜ Example 2:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# Input:  nums = [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,3]
# Output: [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,3,3,3]
# Length: 10
# ðŸŸ¢ Explanation:

# 0 appears 4 â†’ keep 3

# 1 appears 4 â†’ keep 3

# 2 appears once â†’ keep

# 3 appears 4 â†’ keep 3

# ðŸ“˜ Example 3:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# Input:  nums = [5,5,5,5,5]
# Output: [5,5,5]
# Length: 3
# ðŸŸ¢ Explanation: Only 5 is there, and it appears 5 times â†’ keep first 3.

# ðŸ“˜ Example 4:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# Input:  nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
# Length: 3
# ðŸŸ¢ Explanation: All unique values. No duplicates to remove.
